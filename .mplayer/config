# xv works well and is the default, but requires lots of memory and supports
#  only one instance per "port". it doesn't work well with beryl.
# gl and gl2 both require DRI to work well. gl suggests -dr for a speedup, if
#  it works with our hardware. -glfinish gives possibly more correct output at
#  a possible speed cost. they are unwieldy with xfwm, at best eating CPU.
# gl* doesn't work well with translucent desktops.
# gl (as opposed to gl2) blocks upon workspace changes
# x11 can't fullscreen, but almost always works
# fbdev disconnects the video hardware out from under x, works in console
# fbdev2 works better than fbdev on at least intel
# directfb usually locks the terminal/machine
# dga -- says framebuffer allocation failed, obsolete

# screenshot -- Allows acquiring screenshots of the movie using the screenshot
# command (bound to the s key by default). Files named shotNNNN.png will be
# saved in the working directory, using the first available number - no files
# will be overwritten. The filter has no overhead when not used and accepts an
# arbitrary colorspace, so it is safe to add it to the configuration file.
