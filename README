"Gaze into your omphalos." - James Joyce, Ulysses

Omphalos is an integrated tool for network enumeration and domination. It
is designed around Linux's rtnetlink(7) layer and PACKET_MMAP capabilities.
Whereas other tools are geared towards either reconnaissance or directed
attacks, omphalos is designed to "spray the area".

libpcap is used at both build and runtime.

Omphalos currently only builds or runs on a Linux kernel with PACKET_MMAP
sockets. Packet transmission requires at least a 2.6.29 kernel.

III. Usage
===================================================================

CAP_NET_ADMIN capabilities are required for omphalos's usage of packet and
netlink sockets. Omphalos *does not* need to run as root, and generally
should not be. If filesystem-based capability support is present, adding
the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability to the omphalos binary provides all necessary
privileges. Omphalos will try to become the user "nobody" regardless of how
it acquired capabilities; to suppress this, provide the -u argument with an
empty string (-u "").
