==============================================

"Gaze into your omphalos." - James Joyce, Ulysses

Omphalos is an integrated tool for network enumeration and domination. It
is designed around Linux's rtnetlink(7) layer and PACKET_MMAP capabilities.
Whereas other tools are geared towards either reconnaissance or directed
attacks, omphalos is designed to "spray the area".
